A collection of things that I want to re-use.

The 'auto connect event' tool simplifies connecting event publishers with
event subscribers by matching events with correctly named and argumented
private methods.

The 'static tuple' tool is similar to a standard tuple, except that it
provides Equals functionality that only checkes for reference equality,
good for tuple of type used as keys in dictionary for example.

The 'auto connect property' tool simplifies copying properties from one
type to another by copying getters to setters where the name and type is
the same and the protection is public.

The 'type serialiser' converts objects to xml and back, both ends need
to understand the types involved. This can also be used to convert types
to the C# representation which can be nice.

The 'factory' is like the usual factory (a box of constructors), but
provides support for passing parameters to the constructors in a
natural (for C#) way.
